### File to generate over all scores for each player ###
"""
Compare players across their:
    - position
    - league
    - age group
Make an overall score how well they perform and give a final score (like Fifa)
Besides that we want maybe sub-scores in various categories but that is secondary

Furthermore based on soft and hard factors a transfer market value is approximated and compared to its real value
